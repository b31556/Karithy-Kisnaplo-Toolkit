## How to Get Your KSNPLSID

**What is a KSNPLSID?**  
The **KSNPLSID** is a short-lived session ID that allows the toolkit to access restricted data on Kisnapl√≥. Some tools will prompt you to enter it when running.

**How to Obtain It:**

1. Log in to your Kisnapl√≥ account.
    
2. Look at the **end of the URL** in your browser. Your KSNPLSID will be there.

**Expiration:**

- The KSNPLSID is **temporary**.
    
- It expires **after a few minutes of inactivity** or roughly **one hour** automatically.
    
- You will need to obtain a **new KSNPLSID periodically** to continue using the toolkit.
