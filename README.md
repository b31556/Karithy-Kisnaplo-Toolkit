## How to Get Your KSNPLID

**What is a KSNPLID?**  
The **KSNPLID** is a short-lived session ID that allows the toolkit to access restricted data on Kisnapl√≥. Some tools will prompt you to enter it when running.

**How to Obtain It:**

1. Log in to your Kisnapl√≥ account.
    
2. Look at the **end of the URL** in your browser. Your KSNPLID will be there.

	![[Pasted image 20250907223028.png]]

**Expiration:**

- The KSNPLID is **temporary**.
    
- It expires **after a few minutes of inactivity** or roughly **one hour** automatically.
    
- You will need to obtain a **new KSNPLID periodically** to continue using the toolkit.
